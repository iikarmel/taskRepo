a. git status: Shows which files have changed and whether they are ready to be saved in Git.
b. git init: Starts a new Git project in the current folder so Git can track file changes.
c. git commit: Saves the current changes with a message explaining what was done.
d. git push: Sends your saved changes to an online Git repository (like GitHub) so you can share them or keep a backup.

The -u flag links the local branch main to the remote branch origin/main. This allows  to: Use git push and git pull without needing to specify the remote branch every time.And let Git automatically recognize and sync with origin/main.
